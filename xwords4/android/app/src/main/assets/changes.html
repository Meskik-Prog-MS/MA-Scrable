  <h2>CrossWords 4.4.141 release</h2>

  <p>This release changes how background networking works to comply
      with new Google requirements. I highly recommend you upgrade,
      and ask that you report any problems to me quickly.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Lots of internal changes to background networking (for games
          using the relay and Bluetooth) to comply with recent
          requirements from Google. (I hope you won't notice :-) </li>
      <li>Improve Invite-via-Bluetooth dialog, esp. show when a remote
          device was last detected via scan</li>
      <li>Store new games outside Archive group even if created from
          inside it</li>
      <li>Replace "Google Cloud Messaging" with the newer Firebase
          workalike. (You should not notice, at least in the Google
          Play Store version.)</li>
      <li>For Spanish games only, allow trades when fewer than 7 tiles
          remain</li>
      <li>New translations in Arabic, German, Japanese, Norwegian,
          Polish and Portuguese</li>
      <li>Use https instead of http for web communication
          (e.g. wordlist downloads)</li>
      <li>Disable logging for release builds (to improve performance)</li>
      <li>Fix some infrequent crashes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Remove play-via-SMS feature from Google Play Store release
          (Google has rejected my request to let it stay.)
          (Play-via-SMS will remain in
          the <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-droid
          release</a>.)</li>
      <li>Improve communication with the message-passing relay for
          Google Play store release</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
