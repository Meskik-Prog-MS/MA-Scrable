  <h2>CrossWords 4.4.117 release</h2>

  <p>This release removes a handful of words from the built-in English
      wordlists that prevent it from having a family-friendly rating
      in the &quot;Play&quot; store.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Remove 54 (of 41871) words from the CollegeEng wordlist</li>
      <li>Remove 3 words from the Top5000 wordlist (making it, I
          guess, &quot;Top4997&quot; instead)</li>
      <li>Make new CollegeEngFull wordlist available for download in
          case you miss those 54 words</li>
      <li>Incorporate new French and Japanese translations</li>
      <li>Address crash reported through Google (thanks!)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Continue work to support WiFi Direct (currently working
      sporadically)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
