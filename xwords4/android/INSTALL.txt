Here's how I'm building crosswords for Android.

First, my working directory is XWords within this (android/)
directory.  And note that local.properties, also there, needs to be
edited so that sdk.dir points to where your sdk is installed.

Build the jni library (the cross-platform code):
# ../scripts/ndkbuild.sh 

Then build the app for the emulator
# ant install

Build for a device (requires you've set up your keys.  I did this too
long ago to remember how but the info's easy to find):
# ant release
