<a name="should_not"><H4>Who should NOT install this app?</h4></a>

<p>Only people with unlimited text messaging plans should install CrossW-SMS.</p>

<p>Do the math: The typical CrossW-SMS game will mean 40 SMS messages
sent and another 40 received.  (They'll be sent directly between the CrossW-SMS on the
two devices, so you'll never see them!)  Let's say your carrier charges you $0.25 for
each of the 80 messages, a figure at the low end these days.  You'll get charged $20 for
a single game.  Imagine you play a game every day for a month: $600!</p>

<p>Just don't do it! Stick with Crosswords, which uses your data plan,
unless you have unlimited SMS.</p>

<a name="advantages"><h4>What are the advantages of playing via SMS instead of the internet?</h4></a>
<ul>
  <li>Uses less battery: SMS messages take less power to send and receive than network data.</li>

  <li>Better responsiveness: unless an app maintains a constant
  connection to a server (which would make it a huge battery hog) it
  will usually receive SMS messages more quickly than other types of
  data.  So you'll see a move right after your opponent makes it.</li>

  <li>Doesn't use your data plan (but per-message costs will kill you
  if you don't have unlimited texting!)</li>

</ul>
