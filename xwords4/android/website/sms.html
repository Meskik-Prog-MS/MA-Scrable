    <h2>CrossWords and Play-via-Data-SMS</h2>
    <p>Play-via-Data-SMS is one of my favorite features of
      CrossWords. It's super-reliable, and works between GSM phones
      round-the-world without requiring any kind of server. Most apps
      have servers in order to harvest saleable infomation about you
      or to show ads, but CrossWords is ad-free (and not-for-profit)
      and so has always supported this feature.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Google's decided there may be security problems
      with SMS and is prohibiting most apps from continuing to send or
      receive SMS (including Data SMS) if they want to be listed on
      the Play Store. And so I've removed the feature from the
      CrossWords "variant" that's available there. The feature
      remains, however, in other variants, including those at:

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/eehouse/xwords/releases/">Github
            OpenSource repository</a></li>
	        <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xwords/">Sourceforge
	        OpenSource repository</a></li>
	        <li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.eehouse.android.xw4/">F-droid
	        OpenSource "app store"</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>(The GitHub and Sourceforge variants will install over the top
        of the Play Store variant without problems. With the F-droid
        variant, however, you'll have to uninstall your current
        variant first, losing your games and settings.)</p>

    <p>I've also written a data-SMS-forwarding app called
        NBSProxy. With NBSProxy installed, CrossWords will be able to
        communicate using Data SMS without the SMS permissions (since
        NBSProxy has them, and is the one using Android's Data SMS
        functionality.)  Google says that apps whose core
        functionality requires SMS permissions will be allowed on the
        Play Store, so NBSProxy should be available there soon. In the
        meantime, you
        can <a href="https://github.com/eehouse/nbsproxy/releases">get
        it from GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Side note: It'd be helpful to know how many people use the
      Play-via-Data-SMS feature in deciding whether to keep these
      separate variants going. Would you
      mind <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">emailing me</a> and
      letting me know whether you've found it useful?
    </p>

    <p>Thanks!
