<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 78 release</b>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Add new "Studylist" feature. It's off by default to avoid
    confusion, but once enabled (via App Settings/Behavior) it lets
    you add words from the board to a list you'll later study or copy
    to another app. (Thanks to BRS for the idea!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Look, again, at play via Bluetooth now that HTC phones aren't quite so common</li>
  <li>Fix SMS play for KitKat</li>
  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
