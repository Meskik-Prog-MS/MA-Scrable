<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 34 release</b>

<ul>

<li>Don't ignore user's choice of wordlists.  THIS MEANS THAT 
IN-PROGRESS GAMES NOT USING ENGLISH WILL BREAK. (But they were broken 
anyway: using English when you didn't want them to.)</li>
  
<li>Vastly (IMO) improve exchanging tiles: when in exchange mode, draw 
board disabled, and replace toolbar with buttons for commiting or 
abandoning the exchange</li>
  
<li>Stop getting confused when there are multiple wordlists with the 
same name.  They'll all show up, and can be deleted.</li>

<li>Don't lose language choice for a game if user downloads a new wordlist</li>

<li>Change how recent score and bonus value are shown after long-tap 
on scoreboard entry or bonus square: use Android's Toast feature 
instead of drawing directly on the board</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
