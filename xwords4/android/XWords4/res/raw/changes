<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 25 release</b>
<ul>

  <li>Each player can have its own dictionary, and robots have smaller
  ones by default (where available).  This should allow robots to be 
  ...  more human.</li>

  <li>For English, there's a new dictionary with 4288 words that's the 
  default for robot players</li>

  <li>At the game level you now set a language, not a dictionary. 
  Dict choice is done at the player level now -- for those who 
  have a choice and care.</li>

  <li>Load game summaries in background for faster startup</li>

  <li>The ususal list of minor UI tweaks and bug fixes</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
