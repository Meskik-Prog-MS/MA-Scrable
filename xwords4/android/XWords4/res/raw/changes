<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 17 release</b>

<p>This release changes how networked games are created, configured 
and connect with each other.  It tries to make the process simpler and 
should mean it's much more likely to succeed.  I've also scattered 
"new user hints" around the app, dialogs with tips that you can 
dismiss with a "Do not show again" button when you don't need to see 
that hint again.</p>

<p>I'm breaking from tradition and not listing bugs fixed or features 
added here -- because there have been well over 300 separate changes 
committed since the last beta.  Instead I'll outline how you get 
started with a two-player networked game.</p>

<p>Assume you and a friend each have Crosswords on an Android phone. 
You both need to
  <ul>
  <li>Launch Crosswords and tap the "Add networked game" button on 
  your device</li>

  <li>When the game appears, long-tap it and choose "Game settings..." 
  from the menu</li>

  <li>Agree on a "room name" -- let's say it's "andy" --and enter it 
  in the "New room name" text box.</li>

  <li>Scroll to the bottom of the window and tap the "Play game" button</li>

  <li>Wait as your phones connect.  You'll see a status message and 
  maybe a "new user hint", then the status icon in the upper-right 
  will go all-green and boards on both phones will get tiles</li>

  <li>Now the first player makes a move, commits it, and it shows up 
  on the other device.  Rinse, lather, repeat.</li>

  <li>The "relay" server stores moves it receives until it can deliver 
  them.  If you have a bunch of networked games going, choose the 
  "Check server" menu on the main list-of-games screen.  It will 
  redraw all games for which there are waiting messages.  You can then 
  open them and they will sync up.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
