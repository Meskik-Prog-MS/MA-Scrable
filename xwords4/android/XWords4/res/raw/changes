<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 74 release</b>

<p>(Beta 74 fixes a crashing bug but adds nothing new, so the
    previous notes remain in place.)</p>

<p>Beta 73 adds two new features, snapshots of in-progress games
  displayed as part of the main Games List screen, and the ability to
  send invitations by tapping your device against the one you want to
  invite (using &quot;Near Field Communication&quot;, or NFC, which
  Google brands &quot;Android beaming&quot;.)</p>

<p>Both features are optional. NFC is off by default, so you have to
  enable it via Google's system Preferences app. And snapshots, while
  on by default, can be disabled (or resized to better fit your
  screen) in Crosswords' App Preferences section under
  Appearances.</p>
