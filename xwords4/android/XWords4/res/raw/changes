<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 44 release</b>
<ul>

  <li>Fix trades in networked games not being reported</li>
  
  <li>Fix yet another Ice Cream Sandwich issue</li>
  
  <li>Fix bug that prevented undo from working for networked games. 
  (I'll turn undo back on in the next release, after everybody has 
  this fix.)</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>
