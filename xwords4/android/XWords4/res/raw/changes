<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 26 release</b>

<ul>A couple of quick improvements in dictionary display/storage
  <li>Group dictionaries by language</li>
  
  <li>Show location of dictionaries and allow movement between 
  them (if you have an external storage card).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
