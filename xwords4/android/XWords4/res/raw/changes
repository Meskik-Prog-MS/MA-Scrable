<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 71 release</b>

<p>For this release I've redone how you work with games and groups of
  games in the main Games List screen. Now you select one or more
  games, and then the screen's main menu (including the right of the
  action bar for newer devices) changes based on the
  selection. Long-tap to select.  "Context menus" are gone.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think of this. Suggest tweaks. Should I
  redo the rest of the screens in this style; or, to the contrary, put
  things back the way they were? As always, you
  can <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">email me here</a>.</p>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Catch up with Android UI 4.0: make interaction with games and
  groups selection-based</li>
  <li>Fix bug on tiny-screen phones (Thanks O!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use Actionbar and select/act pattern on more screens</li>
  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
