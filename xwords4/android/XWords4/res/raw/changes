<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 30 release</b>

<ul>

  <li>Redesign of how new games -- in particular networked games --
  are created. You can now \"invite\" somebody to a game you're
  creating, or to an existing game that's missing players.</li>

  <li>Make name fields assume upper-case</li>

  <li>Fix/reduce impact of java memory leaks</li>
  
</ul>


<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
