<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 35 release</b>

<ul>

    <li>Add ability to look up words played by opponents via online 
        dictionary sites.  The list of sites is hard-coded, and I don't have 
        them for most languages.  Suggestions welcomed (including improvements 
        for English)!
    </li>

    <li>Rename 'Turn done' menuitem to 'Pass' when no points will be 
        scored
    </li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
