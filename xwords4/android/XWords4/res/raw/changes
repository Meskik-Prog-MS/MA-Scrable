<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 14 release</b>

<ul>New features:
  <li>This spiffy per-release dialog</li>
</ul>

<ul>Bugs fixed:
<li>Crash exiting board view</li>
<li>Hang searching for robot move</li>
<li>Crash putting up progress dialog after board hidden</li>
</ul>

<ul>Coming soon:
  <li>builtin hints and help</li>
  <li>rewrite of gameplay via relay to make connecting easier and allow closed game to receive moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
