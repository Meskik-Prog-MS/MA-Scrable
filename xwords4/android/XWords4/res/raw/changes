<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 53 release</b>
<ul>

  <li>Add a second way devices can play: via SMS.  If you and your
  friends have unlimited texting plans (ONLY IF!!) this is the way to
  go: connecting is easier, moves get transmitted more quickly, and
  less battery is required. <a
  href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_faq.php">See the FAQ</a></li>

  <li>In the main games-list screen, replace green highlighting of the
  player whose turn it is with green transitioning to red over three
  days.  That way you can see how long it's been that person's turn.
  Nothing happens -- yet -- when the three days is up.  Maybe later
  that'll force a resignation.</li>

  <li>Download wordlists without using the browser when possible</li>

  <li>Warn when you join a network game with a different wordlist from
  the host's, and give a chance to download and switch.</li>

  <li>Don't allow networked games to have different wordlist for each
  player.  That feature is for local games only now.</li>

  <li>There's now a preference for where downloaded wordlists are
  stored instead of a question asked each time.</li>

  <li>Recast game-over feature as "resigning".</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
