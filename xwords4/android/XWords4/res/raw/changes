<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 16 release</b>

<p>This is a <em>another</em> quick bug-fix release while I continue 
work on the new relay connection code -- which is coming along, 
BTW.  Please email if you're willing to comment on an early version.</p>

<ul>Bugs fixed:
  <li>Dictionary download could be routed to Browser if you weren't careful or
  your phone maker hard-coded the type.  Now it always routes to Crosswords.
  (Thanks B.S.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>(Still) coming soon
  <li>builtin hints and help, starting with the Game Settings 
  screen</li>

  <li>rewrite of gameplay via relay to make connecting easier (no 
  host/guest stuff or requirement that both be online at the same 
  time) and allow closed game to receive moves.</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
