<h3>New with this release</h3>

    <li>Fix KitKat-only problem drawing green/red move timer outlines</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Look, again, at play via Bluetooth now that HTC phones aren't quite so common</li>
  <li>Fix SMS play for KitKat</li>
  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at
