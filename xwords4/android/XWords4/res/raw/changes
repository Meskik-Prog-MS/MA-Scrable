<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 19 release</b>
<ul>
<li>Beginning with Beta 19 Crosswords will notify the relay when you 
delete a networked game, and the relay will tell others in the game 
when they try to keep playing.)</li>

<li>Fixes a problem drawing wide letters on narrow screens</li>

<li>Fix the Play game button at the bottom of the Game setting 
dialog</li> </ul>

<li>Run on Android 1.5 again -- so you 1.5 user won't have seen an 
upgrade in a while</li>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
