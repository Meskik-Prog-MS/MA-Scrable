<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 26 release</b>

<ul>A quick release to get a much-requested feature in.

  <li>Allow storage of downloaded dictionaries on SD card ("external 
  storage") if present and usable.</li>

  <li>Route all download activities through the Dictionary list view.</li>

</ul>

<p>(Allowing install of the app itself on SD is not recommended because 
of some of the OS features I'm using, e.g. periodic checks for 
moves).</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
