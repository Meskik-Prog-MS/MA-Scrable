<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 20 release</b>
<ul>

  <li>Replace large tournament-grade dictionary with tiny one.  This should address complaints that the robot's too smart.</li>

  <li>When a game depends on a dictionary that's been deleted and there are others available in that language, give the option to substitute instead of refusing to open the game.</li>

  <li>Include number of words in new dictionary format, and display that along with language where available.  You will need to re-download any dictionaries that are not built-in to take advantage of this.</li>

  <li>Try to handle changes in network availability in the middle of a game -- so you don't have to re-open a game to get it to connect.</li>

  <li>Fix glitch drawing board on 600x800 Velocity Cruz eReader tablet -- $160 at Costco, and Crosswords runs great!</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
