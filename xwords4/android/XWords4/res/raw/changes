<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 72 release</b>

<p>This release is for the new x86-processor-based Android devices
  just coming out. Otherwise identical to beta 71, it replaces a
  library for ARM processors with one for x86. Google Play Store
  claims it will only let you download this release if you have a
  compatible device, so here's hoping they got it right!</p>

<p>Thanks to Brendan Le Foll for the patches!</p>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Replace arm processor support with support for x86 processors.
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use Actionbar and select/act pattern on more screens</li>
  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
