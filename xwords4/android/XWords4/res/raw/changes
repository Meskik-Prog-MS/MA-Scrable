<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 86 release</b>

<h3>New with this (and prev.) release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Don't prevent board displaying in the landscape orientation on
    large and x-large devices (tablets)</li>
    <li>Fix changes for above so Nexus 10 and other x-large screened
    devices still use the full screen in the portrait orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Side-by-side display (e.g. games list and a game open at the
      same time) for tablets in landscape mode</li>
  <li>Look, again, at play via Bluetooth now that HTC phones aren't quite so common</li>
  <li>Fix SMS play for KitKat</li>
  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>This is beta software.  Please let me know (at eehouse@eehouse.org)
    what's broken and what features you'd most like to see. And if you
    do get a crash, please let your phone report it to Google so I can
    see it!</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
