<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 43 release</b>
<ul>

  <li>Fix bug that prevented undo from working for networked games.
  (I'll turn undo back on in the next version, after everybody has
  this fix.)</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
