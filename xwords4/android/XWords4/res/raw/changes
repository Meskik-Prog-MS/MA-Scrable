<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 84 release</b>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Rewrite lots of internals getting ready for dual-window
        display (on tablets)</li>
    <li>Make translations (e.g. of menus) downloadable separately
        rather than built in to the app</li>
    <li>Handle display and download of wordlists internally rather
        than handing off to a browser</li>
    <li>Fix lookup/studylist for languages with only one lookup
        option</li>
    <li>When you return from downloading a new wordlist or language
        your new game is now configured to use it</li>
    <li>Add debug option to play via "data" SMS (works only if both
        devices are NOT on Verizon or Sprint in the US)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improve notifications sent to Google Wearable devices (since I just got one :-)</li>
  <li>Look, again, at play via Bluetooth now that HTC phones aren't quite so common</li>
  <li>Fix SMS play for KitKat</li>
  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
