<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 15 release</b>

<p>This is a quick bug-fix release while I continue work on the new relay connection code.</p>

<ul>Bugs fixed:
  <li>Robot wouldn't give up turn when unable to find a move. (Thanks S.A.)</li>
  <li>"Crosshairs" was drawn only three columns wide when started on top row</li>
</ul>

<ul>(Still) coming soon
  <li>builtin hints and help</li>
  <li>rewrite of gameplay via relay to make connecting easier and allow closed game to receive moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
