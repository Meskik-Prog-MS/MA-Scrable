<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 19 release</b>
<ul>
<li>Beginning with Beta 19 Crosswords will notify the relay when you 
delete a networked game, and the relay will tell others in the game 
that you're gone and the game is over.</li>

<li>Fix a problem drawing wide letters on narrow screens</li>

<li>Position the Play game button permanently at the bottom of the 
Game setting dialog -- no scrolling.</li>

<li>Run on Android 1.5 again -- making this the first upgrade in a while 
for you 1.5 users.</li>

<li>Speed up game launch</li>

<li>Improve how missing dictionaries are handled -- e.g. stop crashing</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Letting me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see is the best way to help get this to release quality 
quickly.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
