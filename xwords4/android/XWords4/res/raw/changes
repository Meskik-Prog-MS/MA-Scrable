<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 33 release</b>

<ul>

  <li>Use the term "wordlist" instead of "dictionary" to not imply that 
  there are definitions provided.</li>

  <li>Change how downloaded wordlists are opened to consume much less 
  Java memory.  Downside: wordlists on external storage are not 
  available when that storage is mounted on a computer over USB.</li>

  <li>In the Wordlists screen, hide wordlists stored on external media 
  when the media's not available.  Notice when it becomes available 
  and redraw the list.</li>

  <li>Make a game's language one of several configurable attributes 
  that can be displayed along with the game</li>

  <li>Display relay connection state as being in one of three phases: 
  configured, connected, and with all players present.</li>

  <li>Fix rename of games to work when keyboard opened while dialog 
  up.</li>

  <li>Add icons to games list display so it's easier to tell networked 
  from standalone.  These are placeholders until I can get an artist 
  to help out. :-)</li>

</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
