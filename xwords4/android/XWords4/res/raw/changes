<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 32 release</b>

<p><em>32's a quickie to fix a crash introduced in 31.  So I'll leave the 
older changes in place</em></p>

<ul>

  <li>Give choice between sending invites as TEXT or HTML, then format 
  differently depending</li>

  <li>include link in invites to install Crosswords</li>

  <li>Add expand/contract buttons to games list</li>

  <li>Add ability to rename games</li>
  
  <li>Don't crash when user chooses "Copy"</li>
  
</ul>


<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
