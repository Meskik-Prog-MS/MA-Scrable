<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 38 release</b>
<ul>
    <li>Added a wordlist browser, which you can get to by tapping a 
        wordlist in the Wordlist screen, or by using the wordlist 
        button at the bottom of the game board.  Eventually you'll be 
        able to filter based on length, chosen tiles, etc.  Right now 
        you can scroll through all the words (even 2.7 million of them 
        if you're playing in Polish.)</li>

    <li>Added the "download directory" to locations I search for
        wordlists.  This means that if you're using a browser like
        Opera that doesn't respect apps' registering for certain types
        of data you can still use a wordlist you've downloaded.</li>

    <li>Added "Pick tiles face up" option, settable when you create a 
        game.  This is primarily useful if you want to populate a 
        board to match a game that already exists, say in a newspaper 
        puzzle or online wordgame.</li>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
