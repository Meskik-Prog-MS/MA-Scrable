<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 68 release</b>

<p>This release features a major upgrade to how the app communicates
  with the relay, in essence switching from each game communicating
  individually (and only when open) to the app communicating on behalf
  of all games.  You should notice only that moves are transmitted
  more reliably.  But this being new code you may also notice bugs.
  If you don't <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">tell me about
  them</a> they will not get fixed.
</p>

    <li>Fix Exchange tiles buttons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>

  <li>Offer "Rematch" when game's over</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like
