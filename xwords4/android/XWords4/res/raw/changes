<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 71 release</b>

<p>For this release I've redone how you work with games and groups of
  games in the main Games List screen. Now you select one or more
  games, and then the screen's main menu (including the right of the
  action bar for newer devices) changes based on the
  selection. Long-tap to select.  "Context menus" are gone.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think of this. Suggest tweaks. Should I
  redo the rest of the screens in this style; or, to the contrary, put
  things back the way they were? As always, you
  can <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">email me here</a>.</p>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>More closely follow Android UI guidelines for main Games List
  screen<ul>
      <li>Show count of selected games or groups in title bar</li>
      <li>Long-tap on games and groups selects or deselects rather
        than bringing up a menu</li>
      <li>Tap on icon at left of game row selects or deselects</li>
      <li>Tap on selected game deselects</li>
      <li>Selecting any group deselects all games, and vice versa</li>
      <li>Back button clears any selection, or exits if there is
      none</li>
      <li>Most common actions now have icons for the action bar</li>
      <li>A new game created when a group is selected is placed in
      that group</li>
      <li>Clear selected games inside collapsing group</li>
  </ul></li>

  text for now pending getting icons</li>
