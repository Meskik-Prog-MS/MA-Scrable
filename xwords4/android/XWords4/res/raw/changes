  <li>Add periodic background checks for moves made by other device in 
  multi-device game.</li>

  <li>Improve chat experience: now keeps history for each game.</li>

  <li>Don't allow exchange of 0 tiles</li>

  <li>UI tweaks: bigger bonus square hints; board zooms in a bit more; 
  higher contrast mini-windows; include game name in main page listing; 
  sort list by game name; "Discard" button added to game-deleted notification; 
  make tiles translucent as they're being dragged; etc.
  </li>

  <li>Removed "undo last" option for networked games.  It's not safe...</li>

  <li>Delete partial dictionary left behind by failed download</li>

  <li>Fixed some crashers</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like to see.</p>
