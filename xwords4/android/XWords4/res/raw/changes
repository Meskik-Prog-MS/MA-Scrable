<b>Crosswords 4.4 beta 66 release</b>

<h3>New with this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix menu missing on some tablets</li>

  <li>Disable in-game Chat feature.  (It has bugs that cause games to
    stop syncing moves.  I&amp;ll fix eventually. Let me know if you
    use this feature and I&amp;ll up the priority.)</li>

  <li>Fix crash triggered by resignation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improve communication with relay, part 2.  (Really, I'm almost done!)</li>
</ul>

<p>(The full changelog 
is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Please remember that this is beta software.  Please let me know (at 
eehouse@eehouse.org) what's broken and what features you'd most like 
to see.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
