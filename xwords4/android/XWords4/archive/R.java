 When I've created the invitation, in text or html, I ask

         or messaging app.  Android then asks the user to choose which
         of the installed apps that can process the request he'd like
         to have launched.  This string is passed to Android and used
         as the title of the dialog that presents that choice. 
 This is the body of the text version of the invitation. A URL
         is created with parameters describing the game and
         substituted for "%1$s".
 This is the body of the html version of the invitation. A URL
         is created with parameters describing the game and

         are not legal in xml strings.)
 This is the subject line of the email/text sent to invite
         someone to join a game. 
 When an invitation is sent, the user gets to choose between
    plaintext and html formatting.  These two strings are shown in the
    two buttons in the dialog. 
 The invitation process begins with this query.  The choice is
         between html and plaintext formatting but I also provide some

 Text of "toast" shown when a game is notified by the relay
         that all expected players have registered.  At this point
         play can begin. 
 Text of "toast" (mini window briefly displayed) shown when a
         game first connects to the relay.  The three substitutions
         are the device's order within the game (e.g. 2), the name of
         the room, and how many additional players have not yet
         registered with the relay in this game.  This should be seen
         only once per game. 
 Short for "points", this is shown at the right end of the
         tray in place of the first tile placed along with the points
         the current move would earn if committed. 
 Most users create games with only two players, which is the
         default, but Crosswords supports up to four.  When I'm using
         the above string to encourage the opener of a game missing
         players to invite, IF the number of missing players is
         greater than one this text is appended to the above. 
 Toast shown when players are missing, same time as above
           but more subtle.  
 If a networked game is opened and is not complete, i.e. if it
         is listed as expecting remote players who have not yet shown
         up, then the most likely explanation is that none has been
         invited.  (It's also possible that an invitation has been
         sent, but I have no way of knowing that.) So every time I
         open such a game I give the user a chance to issue an
         invititation while trying to warn him not to send duplicates.
         The number of players missing is substituted for "%1$d".

 Shown the first time the board arrow is drawn on the current
         Board screen.  The idea is that you're tapping around
         figuring out how to play and when you tap an empty cell the
         arrow appears.  This explains it. 
 This is shown in the Board screen when you successfully
         connecting a game to the relay and are the last device in the
         game to do so, i.e. the game is now complete and you should
         expect play to begin. 
 This is shown in the Board screen when you successfully
         connecting a game to the relay and are not the first device
         in the game but not the last either.  So it will only occur
         for games with more than two devices, which are rare. 
 This is shown in the Board screen when you successfully
         connect a game to the relay and are the first device in the
         game to do so. 
 Shown in the Game configure screen when the game_locked
         checkbox is checked and you uncheck it.  
 This is shown when you choose the board_menu_done menu item.
         It's to let you know that there's a shortcut that does almost
         the same thing. 
 Shown when you tap the values button on the toolbar of the
         main Board screen.  This is intended to allow players to
         remind themselves how much played tiles are worth while
         planning a move.

         main Board screen

         main Board screen 
 Shown when you tap the zoom (+/-) button on the toolbar of
