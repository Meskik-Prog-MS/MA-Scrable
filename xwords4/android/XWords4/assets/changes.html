  <h2>Crosswords 4.4 beta 98 release</h2>

  <p>This release is mostly to get the new Dutch translation out
  there, and to catch up Catalan and French.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Complete and up-to-date translations into Dutch, French and
          Catalan. What langauge is next?</li>

      <li>Allow copying invitation URL to clipboard so you can paste
          it into any messaging app you like</li>

      <li>Improvements to in-game chat experience (but more are coming)</li>

      <li>Show a "toast" when hint button can't find any moves</li>

      <li>Add sms to the list of ways you can invite somebody</li>

      <li>When displaying Bluetooth-connected devices to invite, skip
          stuff like headphones</li>
      <li>Turn off email invite attachments. They didn't seem to work anyway,
          and aren't needed on modern Android.</li>
      <li>Fix very old memory leak</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
	  <li>Offer &quot;Rematch&quot; when game&apos;s over (Easy via
	  SMS and Bluetooth; harder via the internet/relay)</li>
      <li>Look into supporting play via peer-to-peer wifi</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
