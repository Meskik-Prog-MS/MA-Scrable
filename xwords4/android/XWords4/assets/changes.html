  <h2>Crosswords 4.4.111 release</h2>

  <p>This release changes the display order of games in the main
  screen, placing those in which it's your turn at the top and games
  that have ended at the bottom. And it fixes an occasional crash in
  side-by-side mode.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Display at the top of the list games in which it's the local
      player's turn</li>

      <li>Display at the bottom of the list games that have ended</li>

      <li>Fix crash launching app in side-by-side mode</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Take advantage of Marshmallow's new permissions model (where
      the app only asks for permission, e.g. to send SMS, when it
      needs it.)
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
