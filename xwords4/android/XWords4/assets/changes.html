  <h2>Crosswords 4.4.113 release</h2>

  <p>This release fixes a drawing problem on Android Nougat version
  only.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Fix (or work around) board drawing weirdness introduced with
      Nougat. It showed most often when using the hint feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Support WiFi Direct (currently working sporadically)</li>
      <li>Take advantage of Marshmallow's new permissions model (where
      the app only asks for permission, e.g. to send SMS, when it
      needs it.)
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
