  <h2>Crosswords 4.4.115 release</h2>

  <p>This release uses the new permissions process introduced with
      "Marshmallow": Crosswords only asks for permissions when they're
      required.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Request permissions when they're needed, e.g. ask to send
      SMS messages when you choose to play a game that way.</li>
      <li>Other permissions required are for access to Storage and to contacts.</li>
      <li>Rework the invitations dialogs. (No new features, but please report any bugs!)</li>
      <li>New two-color icon for notifications (required by the newer
      Android that supports run-time permissions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Continue work to support WiFi Direct (currently working
      sporadically)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
