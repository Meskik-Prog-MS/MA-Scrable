  <h2>Crosswords 4.4.108 release</h2>

  <p>This release fixes a nasty bug in invitations on older Android
  and improves in-game chat functionality.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Fix problem with invitations on older Android versions
      (e.g. 4.2 and 4.3)</li>

      <li>Chat fixes: send without closing the window, expand for
      longer messages, smart editing, etc.</li>

      <li>Fix so Bluetooth finds tablets as well as phones</li>

      <li>Add ability to disable relay play (to save battery for users
      who play standalone only)</li>

      <li>Improvements to French and Japanese translations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Working on dual-pane mode (so e.g. board and chat can be
      side-by-side on tablets)</li>
      <li>Take advantage of Marshmallow's new permissions model (where
      the app only asks for them when it needs them.)
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
