  <h2>Crosswords 4.4 beta 96 release</h2>

  <p>This release changes how networked games are started and
  communicate.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Change how games communicate: instead of using only one
          means (e.g. Bluetooth, SMS, or the internet/relay) a game can
          use all three, switching based on what works at the time</li>

      <li>Game creation means picking whether you&apos;re networked or not,
          not how to communicate (though you can still control that if
          you like)</li>

      <li>Separate inviting from playing: e.g. you can invite via
          Bluetooth to a game that will be played via SMS</li>

      <li>A game that needs remote players has an dialog on top of it
          at all times you can use to invite players. The dialog goes
          away when invited players connect.</li>

      <li>New game are placed in the selected group (if any, otherwise
          in default as before)</li>

      <li>Add new-games buttons to main screen, and offer to hide them
          after a while</li>

      <li>Offer to turn Bluetooth and SMS on directly rather than just
          take you to the Android prefs app</li>

      <li>Hide public rooms interface by default, and add a preference
          to turn it back on</li>

      <li>Remove option to invite using SMS, since invitations are too
          large now. (Will address in a release soon.)</li>

      <li>Kill play-via-SMS for non-GSM phones. (Google&apos;s making
          it too hard to support this, and it only matters in one
          country anyway.)</li>

      <li>When assigning new tiles, don&apos;t sort tiles to left of tray
          divider</li>

      <li>Don&apos;t post empty notifications</li>

      <li>Remove &quot;Reconnect&quot; button from network status info</li>

      <li>Include info for all communication means being used in
          network status </li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
	  <li>Offer &quot;Rematch&quot; when game&apos;s over (Easy via
	  SMS and Bluetooth; harder via the internet/relay)</li>
      <li>Fix invite-by-SMS (and then re-enable)</li>
      <li>Look into supporting play via peer-to-peer wifi</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know (email eehouse@eehouse.org) what&apos;s broken
     and what features you&apos;d most like to see. And if you do get
     a crash, please let your device report it to Google so I can see
     it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
