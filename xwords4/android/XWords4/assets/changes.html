  <h2>Crosswords 4.4 beta 93 release</h2>

  <p>This is an interim release making low-level network changes that
  need to be out there before the next, more ambitious set of changes
  can go out. Once this version&apos;s been adopted I can release the
  next without breaking networked games that are in progress.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Change &quot;protocol&quot; of messages passed between games
          to include more information.</li>
      <li>Replace "Do not show again" button in new-player hint
          dialogs with a checkbox</li>
      <li>Resend pending messages every time game is opened</li>
      <li>Fix crash downloading wordlists</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
	  <li>Finish fixing things so you don&apos;t have to specify how
	      two devices will communicate: Bluetooth, Relay, SMS -
	      shouldn&apos;t be something you have to pick. I should just
	      use what works at the time.  (This is coming along, but
	      still weeks out.)</li>

	  <li>Offer &quot;Rematch&quot; when game&apos;s over (easy if I get
	      the above right)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know (email eehouse@eehouse.org) what&apos;s broken
     and what features you&apos;d most like to see. And if you do get
     a crash, please let your device report it to Google so I can see
     it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
