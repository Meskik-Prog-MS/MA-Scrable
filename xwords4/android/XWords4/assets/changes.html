  <h2>Crosswords 4.4 beta 102 release</h2>

  <p>This release introduces "Rematch", a way to create new games from
  existing ones that short-circuits all the configuration and
  invitation nonsense. (Nonsense, anyway, after the first time.)
  Invitations are cleaned up. And it is the second of two releases
  that together fix stalling issues in network games. </p>

  <p>I hope you like it!</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Rematch option allows creating a new game with the same
          opponents, and takes care of sending invitations to the
          remote device</li>
      
      <li>Improve how invitations are created and sent, including
          making it easier to resend when necessary</li>

      <li>Finish fixing problem with moves being dropped</li>

      <li>Make it easier to "discover" and enable play-via-SMS (GSM
          phones only)</li>

      <li>Fix memory leak that caused crashes if you opened a lot of
          games in a short period</li>

      <li>Ask player for name the first time it's needed rather than
          when newly installed game first opened</li>

      <li>Fix occasional failure to refresh thumbnails</li>

      <li>Don't allow removing players when game is locked (in Game
          Config screen)</li>

      <li>Put back long-tap (a.k.a. "context") menus in Games List
          screen. Because I like them</li>

      <li>No reminders in robot games by default</li>

      <li>Tweaks to Chat screen, and confirm before deleting chat
          history</li>

      <li>Tweak notifications to make them more useful</li>
      
      <li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Take advantage of Marshmallow's new permissions model (where
      the app only asks for them when it needs them.)
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
