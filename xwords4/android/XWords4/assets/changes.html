  <h2>Crosswords 4.4 beta 92 release</h2>

  <p>This is an interim release with a few quick bug fixes. I'm still
  working on the next big one (rethinking how game invitations
  work).</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Set a default language to fix bug setting default wordlists
      when default language hasn&apos;t been set</li>

      <li>When game is over tap on opponent&apos;s score will show you
      his/her tiles</li>

      <li>Fix a couple of potential crashers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
	  <li>Fix things so you don&apos;t have to specify how two devices
	      will communicate: Bluetooth, Relay, SMS - shouldn&apos;t be
	      something you have to pick. I should just use what works at
	      the time.  (This is coming along, but still weeks out.)</li>

	  <li>Offer &quot;Rematch&quot; when game&apos;s over (easy if I get
	      the above right)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know (email eehouse@eehouse.org) what&apos;s broken
     and what features you&apos;d most like to see. And if you do get
     a crash, please let your device report it to Google so I can see
     it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
