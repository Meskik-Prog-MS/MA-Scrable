  <h2>Crosswords 4.4.109 release</h2>

  <p>This release adds experimental support for side-by-side views on
      tablets.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	Crosswords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Add side-by-side mode for tablets. For now, it's an option
      you'll be encouraged to enable. Later it'll always be on.</li>

      <li>For small screens, make alerts' content scrollable</li>

      <li>Modern phones have multi-touch screens, so remove old ways
          of zooming board</li>

      <li>Improve generation of board snapshots</li>

      <li>Move "Play sound" preference</li>

      <li>Fix problem with invitations and unclosable games</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog 
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Next up</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Take advantage of Marshmallow's new permissions model (where
      the app only asks for permission, e.g. to send SMS, when it
      needs it.)
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
